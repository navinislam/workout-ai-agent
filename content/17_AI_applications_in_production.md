# Building Production AI Applications

So far, we have explored all of the important concepts when it comes to building AI applications.

This section of the course will focus on what it takes to build AI applications in real production environments and some best practices.

## 1. Guardrails: Protecting Your AI System

We already explained previously that your AI applications might be susceptible to malicious attacks using AI, with things like prompt injection or jailbreaking. Your users might expose private information that you don't want to leak. Note that many third-party APIs (like OpenAI) provide many guardrails out of the box for you.

### Input Guardrails: First Line of Defense

These protect against leaking private information to external APIs and executing bad prompts that might compromise your system. There are many tools that can automatically detect sensitive data (specified by you) which usually use AI and you can block that from being sent to the model.

**Real Example - Healthcare Platform:** A medical AI assistant needed to prevent PHI (Protected Health Information) from being sent to external LLM APIs:

**Implementation:**
- Built custom NER (Named Entity Recognition) models to detect patient names, SSNs, medical record numbers
- Used regex patterns for structured data like phone numbers and addresses
- Implemented keyword blocking for medication names and diagnosis codes
- Set up real-time scanning with 50ms latency requirement

**Detection Rules:**
- Social Security Numbers: `\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}` pattern matching
- Patient IDs: Custom format recognition for hospital-specific numbering
- Medical terms: Blocked 2,847 specific medication names and 1,203 diagnosis codes
- Personal identifiers: Names cross-referenced against patient database

**Results:** Prevented 234 PHI leaks in first month, reduced compliance risk, enabled use of external AI while maintaining HIPAA compliance.

**Common Input Guardrail Categories:**
- **PII Detection:** Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, SSNs
- **Financial Data:** Credit card numbers, account numbers, routing numbers
- **Corporate Secrets:** Product names, financial figures, strategic plans
- **Prompt Injection:** Attempts to override system instructions
- **Malicious Content:** Attempts to generate harmful or illegal content

### Output Guardrails: Quality Control for AI Responses

This is to catch outputs that fail to meet your standards. Like a model returning inappropriate information or even hateful or illegal information. One thing to note is that output guardrails might not work well in streaming completion mode.

**Real Example - Customer Service AI:** A telecommunications company implemented output filtering for their customer service chatbot:

**Multi-Layer Filtering:**
1. **Content Safety:** Used Azure Content Safety API to detect hate speech, violence, self-harm content
2. **Brand Compliance:** Custom classifier trained on 10,000 examples of appropriate vs. inappropriate responses
3. **Accuracy Validation:** RAG citation checker to ensure responses are grounded in knowledge base
4. **Tone Analysis:** Sentiment analysis to ensure responses maintain professional, helpful tone

**Implementation Details:**
- Real-time processing with 80ms average latency
- Confidence thresholds: Block responses with >70% toxicity score
- Fallback responses: Pre-written safe responses when AI output is blocked
- Human escalation: Flagged conversations where multiple responses were blocked

**Results:** 
- Reduced inappropriate responses by 94%
- Customer satisfaction increased from 3.2 to 4.1 (out of 5)
- Prevented potential brand damage incidents
- Saved estimated $1.2M in reputation management costs

**Streaming Challenge:** Output guardrails are harder to implement with streaming responses because you can't analyze the complete response before sending it. Solutions include:
- Sentence-level filtering (check each sentence as it's generated)
- Sliding window analysis (analyze last N tokens continuously)
- Conservative settings (higher blocking thresholds for streaming)

## 2. Model Router and Gateway: Intelligent Traffic Management

### Router: The Right Model for the Right Task

This is a common pattern in AI applications. Instead of using one model for all queries, you use different ones. In practice, and speaking from experience, most AI applications use different models for different tasks. This can help save costs where you can use a less expensive model for simpler queries.

A router consists of logic that predicts what the user is trying to do, and based on that intent, the query is routed to the appropriate model (again that typically uses AI). There are some out of the box, or you can build your own with a small language model.

**Real Example - E-commerce Platform:** An online retailer built a sophisticated routing system for their customer queries:

**Intent Classification:**
- **Simple Questions** (43% of queries): "What's my order status?" → Route to fast, cheap model (GPT-3.5)
- **Product Recommendations** (31% of queries): "Find me a laptop for gaming" → Route to specialized RAG system
- **Complex Support** (18% of queries): "I need to return this but the website won't let me" → Route to premium model (GPT-4) + human escalation
- **Technical Questions** (8% of queries): "How do I set up this router?" → Route to technical documentation model

**Router Implementation:**
- Built lightweight classifier using 500-parameter model (inference cost: $0.0001 per query)
- Training data: 50,000 labeled customer queries from support tickets
- Real-time prediction with 25ms latency
- Confidence thresholds: Route to premium model if classification confidence <85%

**Cost Impact:**
- Before routing: Average $0.012 per query (all queries to GPT-4)
- After routing: Average $0.004 per query (67% cost reduction)
- Monthly savings: $89,000 with same or better response quality
- Customer satisfaction improved due to faster responses for simple queries

**Advanced Routing Strategies:**
- **Load-based routing:** Route to different models based on current API load
- **User-tier routing:** Premium customers get better models
- **Context-aware routing:** Route based on conversation history and complexity
- **A/B testing integration:** Route percentage of traffic to experimental models

### Gateway: Unified Model Management

This allows you to connect to different models in a secure manner. It is a unified interface to different models, which makes it easy to maintain your code. You can typically apply throttling at the gateway level, track usage, etc.

**Real Example - Financial Services Company:** A investment firm built a model gateway to manage 12 different AI models across their organization:

**Gateway Architecture:**
- **Single API Endpoint:** All applications connect to one URL regardless of underlying model
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with role-based model access
- **Rate Limiting:** Different limits for different user tiers and models
- **Model Abstraction:** Same request format works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and internal models

**Features Implemented:**
- **Automatic Failover:** If primary model is down, automatically route to backup
- **Usage Tracking:** Track costs per department, user, and model
- **Request Logging:** Store all requests/responses for audit and training
- **Model Versioning:** Support multiple versions of same model with gradual rollouts

**Business Impact:**
- **Developer Productivity:** Reduced integration time for new models from 2 weeks to 2 hours
- **Cost Management:** Centralized billing and usage analytics across all teams
- **Compliance:** Single point for audit logging and security controls
- **Reliability:** 99.7% uptime with automatic failover (vs 94% with direct API calls)

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Example gateway request - same format regardless of model
POST /gateway/v1/chat/completions
{
    "model": "best-for-finance",  # Gateway resolves to actual model
    "messages": [...],
    "user_tier": "premium",       # Affects routing and rate limits
    "department": "trading"       # For cost tracking
}
```

## 3. Caching: Speed and Cost Optimization

Caching is not new in software development. It has been used to reduce latency and cost (to avoid constant database querying). There are different caching techniques when it comes to AI.

### Exact Caching: Perfect Matches

For instance, if a user asks the model to summarize a product, the system checks the cache to see if a summary of this exact product exists. This is used to avoid constant vector search. This can be implemented using in-memory storage like Redis.

**Real Example - News Aggregation Platform:** A news website implemented exact caching for article summaries:

**Implementation:**
- **Cache Key:** SHA-256 hash of article URL + summary length parameter
- **Storage:** Redis cluster with 72 hours TTL (news becomes stale quickly)
- **Cache Size:** 500GB storing ~2M article summaries
- **Hit Rate:** 67% of summary requests served from cache

**Performance Impact:**
- **Latency:** Cache hits respond in 15ms vs. 2.3 seconds for AI generation
- **Cost Savings:** $23,000/month saved on LLM API calls
- **User Experience:** Instant loading for popular articles
- **Scalability:** Handled 10x traffic spike during major news events

**Cache Strategy:**
- Proactive caching for trending articles (cache before users request)
- Intelligent eviction: Remove summaries for articles with <10 views
- Geographic distribution: Cache popular articles in multiple regions

### Semantic Caching: Similar Intent Matching

Cached items are used even if they are semantically similar (not identical query). This requires a vector database to store embeddings of cached queries so it is more complicated and is compute intensive. The speed and cost might not be worth it.

**Real Example - Legal Research Platform:** A legal AI assistant implemented semantic caching for case law research:

**Challenge:** Lawyers often ask similar questions in different ways:
- "What are the precedents for breach of contract in California?"
- "Show me California case law on contract violations"
- "Find breach of contract cases from CA courts"

**Implementation:**
- **Vector Storage:** Pinecone database storing query embeddings
- **Similarity Threshold:** Cache hit if cosine similarity >0.85
- **Embedding Model:** text-embedding-ada-002 for consistent representations
- **Cache Scoring:** Weighted by query popularity and recency

**Performance Analysis:**
- **Cache Hit Rate:** 34% of queries matched semantically similar previous queries
- **Cost per Hit:** $0.15 (embedding lookup + vector search)
- **Cost per Miss:** $3.20 (full legal research with RAG)
- **Break-even:** Semantic caching profitable with >4.6% hit rate

**Results:**
- Average response time reduced from 8.2 seconds to 1.7 seconds for cache hits
- 31% reduction in overall compute costs
- Improved user experience with faster research results
- Challenges: Complex cache invalidation when legal precedents change

**When Semantic Caching Makes Sense:**
- High-cost AI operations (complex RAG, long documents)
- Repetitive user patterns (customer support, research)
- Stable knowledge domains (legal, medical, technical documentation)

**When to Avoid Semantic Caching:**
- Low-cost AI operations (simple chat completions)
- Highly dynamic content (real-time data, breaking news)
- Privacy-sensitive queries (each user needs fresh results)

## 4. Observability: Monitoring AI Performance

Again, observability is a universal practice across software engineering. Specific to AI, it is typically number of input and output tokens per request, format failures (if you expect JSON outputs, track how often the model gives invalid JSON). For open-ended generations, consider things like conciseness, creativity, or positivity - many of these metrics can be computed using AI judges.

### Core AI Metrics

**Real Example - SaaS Platform:** A project management tool with AI features tracks comprehensive metrics:

**Token and Cost Metrics:**
- **Input tokens per request:** Average 342 tokens, 95th percentile 1,247 tokens
- **Output tokens per request:** Average 156 tokens, max capped at 500
- **Cost per request:** $0.0034 average, trending down 12% month-over-month
