# LLMOps: End-to-End AI Application Lifecycle

## What is LLMOps?

We've had practices like DevOps before, which is an end-to-end framework for developing, testing, and deploying applications containing a set of tools (like GitHub, Jenkins, etc). LLMOps is a similar concept - it is a collection of tools and processes to develop, deploy, and maintain LLM-based applications.

The fundamental difference is that traditional DevOps deals with deterministic code (the same input always produces the same output), while LLMOps deals with probabilistic AI systems where outputs can vary, models need retraining, and data quality directly impacts performance.

## The LLMOps Pipeline: 7 Critical Stages

### 1. Data Curation: The Foundation of AI Success

This explores what data is available, outlining data transformations to create clean and consistent data. Do you need to enrich the data? Do you need to map the data with external data to enrich it? This is all part of the data curation process.

**The Challenge:** Raw enterprise data is messy, inconsistent, and often incomplete. Before any AI model can work effectively, you need to transform this data into a format that produces reliable results.

#### Azure Tools for Data Curation:

**Azure Data Factory (ADF):**
- **Purpose:** Orchestrate data pipelines from multiple sources
- **Capabilities:** 90+ built-in connectors, visual pipeline designer, automated scheduling
- **Use Case:** Extract data from SAP, Salesforce, Oracle, Excel files, and transform for AI consumption

**Microsoft Fabric:**
- **Purpose:** Unified analytics platform combining data engineering, data warehouse, and real-time analytics
- **Capabilities:** OneLake data lake, Spark notebooks, real-time streaming, T-SQL endpoints
- **Use Case:** Process millions of customer records, clean transaction data, perform complex joins at scale

**Microsoft Purview:**
- **Purpose:** Data governance, discovery, and lineage tracking across the entire data estate
- **Capabilities:** Automated data classification, PII detection, data lineage visualization, data catalog
- **Use Case:** Catalog all enterprise data sources, track data lineage for compliance, identify sensitive data

#### Real Implementation Example:

**Challenge:** A manufacturing company needed to curate data for predictive maintenance AI from 23 different systems across 8 global facilities.

**Data Sources:**
- SAP ERP (equipment specifications and maintenance history)
- Historian databases (sensor readings every 30 seconds)
- CMMS system (work orders and technician notes)
- Excel spreadsheets (manual inspection reports)
- IoT sensors (real-time temperature, vibration, pressure data)

**Microsoft Fabric Pipeline:**
1. **Extraction:** 
   - SAP connector pulls equipment data nightly via Data Factory
   - Event Hub ingests real-time IoT sensor data into Fabric OneLake
   - Blob storage connector processes Excel files uploaded by technicians

2. **Transformation:**
   - Fabric Spark notebooks standardize equipment naming across facilities
   - Convert sensor readings to consistent units using Fabric data flows
   - Clean technician notes using Azure AI Language services

3. **Validation:**
   - Data quality rules: Sensor readings within expected ranges using Fabric data activator
   - Completeness checks: Critical fields like equipment ID cannot be null
   - Consistency validation: Cross-reference equipment specs with actual sensor capabilities

**Results:**
- Data processing time reduced from 3 days to 4 hours
- Data quality score improved from 67% to 94%
- Created unified dataset of 2.3 million maintenance events ready for AI training

### 2. Experimentation: Trial and Error at Scale

This is when you run your LLM solution with different data, different prompts, different models, etc. One of the most common questions I get from clients I work with is: how do I know if my data is right for AI? The answer is trial and error. There are basic guidelines, which we discussed in the previous section, but trial and error when it comes to AI is extremely important.

#### Azure Tools for Experimentation:

**Azure AI Foundry:**

- **Capabilities:** Llama 3.1, Mistral Large, Phi-3, Cohere Command, and 50+ other models
- **Use Case:** Cost-effective alternatives to OpenAI, specialized models for specific domains

#### Experimentation Best Practices:

**Systematic Prompt Testing:**
```python
# Example experimentation framework
experiments = [
    {
        "prompt_template": "Summarize this document in {length} words: {document}",
        "model": "gpt-4-turbo",
        "temperature": 0.3,
        "length_variants": [50, 100, 200]
    },
    {
        "prompt_template": "Create a {length}-word summary of: {document}",
        "model": "gpt-4-turbo", 
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "length_variants": [50, 100, 200]
    }
]
```

**Data Variation Testing:**
- Test with different data volumes (1K, 10K, 100K examples)
- Vary data quality (clean vs noisy datasets)
- Test across different domains (product reviews vs technical documentation)
- Cross-validate with different time periods (recent vs historical data)

### 3. Evaluation: Measuring What Matters

    metrics = {
        "groundedness": check_citations_accuracy(response, source_documents),
        "relevance": score_relevance(question, response),
        "coherence": assess_readability(response),
        "completeness": measure_answer_completeness(question, response)
    }
    return metrics
```
